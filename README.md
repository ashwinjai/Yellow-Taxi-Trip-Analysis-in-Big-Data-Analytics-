# Yellow Taxi Trip Analysis in Big Data Analytics

## Project Overview

## Problem Statement
The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) has furnished a comprehensive dataset documenting taxi trips within the city. This detailed trip-level dataset extends beyond a mere compilation of pickup and drop-off coordinates. <br>

The dataset encompasses various fields, capturing essential information such as pickup and drop-off dates and times, location coordinates for both the starting and ending points, trip distances, itemized fare details, rate classifications, payment methods, and driver-reported passenger counts. It is important to note that the data utilized in this context was meticulously collected and supplied to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission by authorized technology providers operating under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs (TPEP/LPEP). <br>

The primary objective of this dataset is to enhance comprehension of the taxi system, enabling the city of New York to optimize in-city commuting efficiency. Numerous exploratory questions can be posed to gain insights into the travel experience for passengers. <br>
